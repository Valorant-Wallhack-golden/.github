## 🔍 What Is Valorant Wallhack?

A **Valorant wallhack** (also called ESP – Extra Sensory Perception) is a visual cheat that lets you **see enemies and objects through walls**, terrain, and smokes. It overlays key data like:

* 📦 Player position
* 💀 Skeletons or hitboxes
* 💬 Agent names & abilities
* 🩸 Health bars
* 🔫 Equipped weapons
* 🔍 Visibility status

You’re basically playing with **built-in wall radar** — **clutches become free**, and you’ll never get surprise headshotted again 😎

## ⚙️ System Compatibility

* 🪟 Windows 10 / 11

**Injection Type:**

* External (overlay + memory read) = safer
